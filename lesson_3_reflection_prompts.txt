When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Two functions come to mind: when sharing code between computers (instead of having to sync files to each local computer) and, more frequently, when sharing work with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You will probably have changes made in your local repository that you aren't ready to be made public - e.g. you are working on features but haven't implemented all of them yet.
