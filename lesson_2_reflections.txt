Lesson Two reflections:
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Creates the hidden .git directory, includes metadata
Can't track changes in a repository that doesn't exist!

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Add all incremental updates into staging, but don't actually run the commit until everything you want added has been staged.
